You can open each post to read it in full at the source, or you can click the preview button to read the article description. You can select multiple feeds at once by adding new links to other sources. The posts are updated automatically in real time. <code>[Let's try it!](https://frontend-project-11-ninja095-ninja095.vercel.app/)</code>
